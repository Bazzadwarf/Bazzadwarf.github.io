*During July 2024, I completed the Unreal Engine 5 Development Skills Bootcamp with INFINITY27!*

For the skills bootcamp, I was a developer for four weeks. I was tasked with designing and implementing a spell into Samsara. I implemented my spell into the game using Blueprints and then C++. I delivered a presentation giving an overview of my spell, the design intents behind the spell, how the spell works, the implementation details, an overview of the performance and areas for improvement and future enhancements.

When designing my spell I managed to plan out my scope so that I was able to meet all my deadlines as they were scheduled to be completed. I was able to implement my spell as initially planned with little revision work along the way. I was able to convert my spell from Blueprints to C++ with very few problems. With the extra time I had I was able to put together a presentation that I am very happy with.

In retrospect, I had a good approach to the project, I got to learn new areas of Unreal, I approached the task with a spell that I was confident in being able to implement in the time available which minimised and stress or anxiety that would have come from a more eccentric design. Being able to bounce ideas off of other developers allowed me to more easily get over any blockers that might have arisen when implementing my ideas.
