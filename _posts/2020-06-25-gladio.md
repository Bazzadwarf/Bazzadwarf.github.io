*Standing among the trees, a horde of warriors are on their way. Pick your weapon and survive!*

*Survive and kill as much as possible to get the highest score! Challenge your friends and find out who is the best warrior!*

Gladio marked the first project that I had created which makes use of VR. Created using Unity, Gladio introduced a new paradigm for game creation to me. This posed many new challenges: how does VR work? How can I make a game using it? How do you interact with a program when using an input method that I had never used before? Gladio was full of learning about VR, and a lot of time was spent collaborating and working through issues as a team. My main responsibilities involved configuring the UI/Menus, HUD Elements, Highscore System, and Sounds.

## What is Gladio

Gladio is a first-person Virtual Reality Sword Fighting game where the player fights against oncoming hordes of enemies to gain as many points as possible. To accomplish this, the player must use his/her sword to fight off the incoming enemies while using his/her shield to defend against the other enemies.
