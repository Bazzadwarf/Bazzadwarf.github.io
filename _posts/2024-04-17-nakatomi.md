*A Liminal Third Person Shooter with destructable elements.*

---

Nakatomi is a solo project created using Unreal Engine during 2023/2024. Nakatomi marks the first major game project that I have developed after finishing my studies at university and after taking an extended break due to personal matters. For Nakatomi, almost all of the project is done entirely by myself, including but not limited to: all the programming, creating 3D models, sampling sound effects, particle effects, etc. The main idea for the game was to create a third-person shooter with destructible environmental elements and a gun that, instead of reloading, you can throw into the world and would explode and affect the environment.

My main aim with this project was to get reacquainted with Unreal Engine. As part of this, I had the opportunity to test out some of the systems that I had previously not had the chance to use. For example, using the Chaos system to implement destructible assets, implementing a project-specific character movement component, and creating particle effects using Niagara. Additionally, it has marked my first introduction to using Blender. While my modeling skills are firmly in the programmer art category, I look forward to building on my skills as I create more content. It has been very satisfying to get back into creating games, it has rekindled a passion in me that I hope to carry forward as this project progresses, as well as into new games that I create in the future.
