This is the source code and resources for the website at [https://louishobbs.com](https://louishobbs.com).

## What is this site for?

At present, this website is a small portfolio site for displaying some of my portfolio work with the outside world!

Plans are under way to extend the use of the website in other areas as well, but at this point in time nothing is set in stone.
