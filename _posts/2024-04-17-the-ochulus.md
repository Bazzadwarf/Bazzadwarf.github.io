*The Ochulus is a Bot for Discord, used for tracking and searching games.*

---

The Ochulus is a bot for the social platform Discord, written in JavaScript using Node.js. The Ochulus was born out of a resurgence of a desire between myself and a close group of friends. After finishing school, myself and a longtime friend challenged each other to attempt to beat 100 games in a year. Ultimately, a year turned into four, but we had a good time doing it. In 2023, we decided to once again tackle this challenge. In our first attempt, we kept track through a hodgepodge of Facebook groups and spreadsheets. But this time, I wanted to create a central place to keep track of everything. This led to the idea of creating a bot for Discord.

The Ochulus marked my first experience creating a bot as well as using JavaScript. Using Discord.js, I created a bot that works in conjunction with the Internet Game Database (IGDB) to track games that we had beaten towards our 100 Games Challenge. All the information would be stored in a SQL database using Sequelize. While being a new challenge for myself, I enjoyed the challenges I overcame while creating the bot.

The core of The Ochulus is its tracking of games. You can track beaten games as well as games that you are currently playing, as well as games you plan to play. You can search the IGDB for games that count towards the 100 game challenge, get details on specific games from the IGDB, and get random games either from your planned games or from IGDB. The Ochulus is an ongoing project that I look forward to expanding on over time.
