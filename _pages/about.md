### Ay Up, I'm Louis!

I'm a recent Computer Games Programmer Graduate from the University of Derby, currently living in Nottingham. I've spent my life growing up around Video Games and creating them myself in recent years. These days I spend my time looking into new rendering techniques and thinking critically about creating better competitive gameplay mechanics.

As an undergraduate student, I worked on various projects. In Early 2019, I was the Lead Programmer for Digital Imp Studios on the Souls-Like Hack-n-Slash game [Infernal Sin](/infernal-sin/). Starting in Early 2018, I was a developer on [Gladio](/gladio/), a Virtual Reality Fighting Game. Later in 2019, I was a researcher for a Joint Research Project between the University of Derby and Amey Consulting on the simulation of large scale CAD models in Virtual Reality.  

Most of my programming experience is in C# and C++ (and a bit of C). For Game Tools, I am most confident with Unity and Unreal Engine (if you were wondering I don't have a preference between the two!). Still, I am easily adaptable to new languages, technologies and tools.
