## More about me!

I have a deep passion for video games. I enjoy trying out a diverse range of games, from new releases to classic gems. I believe that everyone should be trying out new games to experience and to learn from how different developers overcome the challenges in making their games fun. I also enjoy designing games that I would like to make, I enjoy coming up with gameplay loops and the mechanics that could help feed into them. I've been playing the video game *osu!* for over a decade and I have had the opportunity to attend many LAN events because of this, they are always a great joy to attend. 

Outside of games, I enjoy taking time away from my screens to read. I largely enjoy Sci-Fi and non-fiction but I am always open to a good novel. For the last few years I have been closely following Formula 1, I am a big fan of the current Williams Racing team and have a great respect for the McLaren F1 team. I have a lifelong passion for baking and cooking, I've recently been experimenting with pizza-making at home.
